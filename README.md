# Admission Lead Interest Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a Machine Learning project built using live admission lead data.
The goal of this project is to predict whether a lead is highly interested or low interested
in taking admission.

## 📊 Dataset
- Real-world (live) admission lead data
- Contains lead names and contact numbers
- Data was raw and unstructured

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Feature Preparation  
3. Label Creation (High Interest / Low Interest)  
4. Supervised Machine Learning Model  
5. Model Training and Prediction  

## 🤖 Machine Learning Details
- Type: Supervised Learning
- Objective: Lead Interest Prediction
- Output: High Interested / Low Interested leads
